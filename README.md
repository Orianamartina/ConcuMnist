# CONCUMNIST

CONCUMNIST is a concurrent programming project designed to demonstrate the use of its techniques to efficiently handle multiple tasks simultaneously.
The objective is to guess the number contained in a 28x28 pixel grayscale image.
To achieve this, the project uses MNIST, a large database of handwritten digits used to train machine learning models and image processing systems. 
It guesses the number from the user's input by calculating its distance using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, comparing each image in the dataset with the user's input.
This program can also run in TEST mode, using as input a CSV file with MNIST data.
